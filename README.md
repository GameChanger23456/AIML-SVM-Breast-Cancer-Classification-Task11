# AIML-SVM-Breast-Cancer-Classification-Task11
Built an end-to-end breast cancer classification model using SVM. Data was cleaned, scaled with StandardScaler, and split into train-test sets. Linear and RBF kernels were compared, then tuned via GridSearchCV. Best model evaluated using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and saved as a reusable pipeline for reliable predictions in deployment ready use
